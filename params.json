With email, for example, you can forward your mail to your new address and use IMAP to copy over your old email (look for those two features before using an email service). With social networks, you can copy over your photo albums (http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/10/12/facebook-photo-importer-lets-you-transfer-hundreds-of-photos-in-minutes/), but you can't copy over your friends. If you can't move your friends, you're essentially locked in to the service. The service loses an important incentive to improve itself, and it can proceed directly to monetizing you for all you're worth in ways you might not agree with, and any attempts to move by yourself will simply make you an outcast.\r\n\r\n### How **Super Share Box** Fixes Social Network Lock-In\r\n**Super Share Box** is an experiment in breaking lock-in. Instead of directly copying your friends to a new social network, it automatically shares links to your posts on the new social network to your old social networks where your friends can see them (in the Google+ case, by choosing your friends and friend lists from the old social network directly in the share box). Since the posts on the old social network will just contain truncated text and a link, your friends on the old social network will have to click through to the new one to see your full post, and they are more likely to interact it with it there.\r\n\r\n**Super Share Box** currently only supports Google+ as the new social network and Facebook and Twitter as the old social networks. The basic concept should translate into any combination of from/to networks, and the goal is to generalize the extension to simplify migration to any social network.
