Super Share Box
===============

Exposes friends and friend groups from other social networks (currently Facebook and Twitter) in the Google+
share box by wrapping the circles XHR.
Wraps the post message XHR to determine whether the post should be shared to those other social networks.
Posts links to the Google+ post on the other social networks.

Pull requests appreciated. Suggestions:
- Clean up the code (even comments and style fixes) and write tests.
- Add more social networks to share to.
- Add support for sharing from social networks besides Google+.
- Localization.
- Firefox extension.
- Anything in the issues list.

Developing Chrome extensions is very easy.
Just go to [Three bars (formerly wrench)] -> Tools -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked Extension and choose the directory
containing this code. Open the files in an editor, make changes, and just refresh the Google+ tab when you're done.
